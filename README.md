### A minimal, unobtrusive Wordpress starter theme with Gulp and Metabox.

*"In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few."*
*--Shunryu Suzuki*

## Gulp
Gulp is used to compile:
- SASS from the `/sass` directory into style.css.
- JS from the `/js` directory into main.js

Simply run `gulp` in the theme directory to watch for SASS and JS changes.
