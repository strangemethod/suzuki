### A minimal, unobtrusive Wordpress starter theme with Gulp and Metabox.

## Gulp
Gulp is used to compile SASS from teh `/sass` directory into style.css.

Simply run `gulp` in the theme directory to watch for SASS changes.


## Metabox

Metabox (https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/) is used to create sane content editing environment.
