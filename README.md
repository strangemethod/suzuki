*"In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few."*
*--Shunryu Suzuki*

## Gulp
Gulp is used to compile SASS from teh `/sass` directory into style.css.

Simply run `gulp` in the theme directory to watch for SASS changes.


## Metabox
The author believes that the default Wordpress authoring interface should be considered harmful when used as a CMS for non-blog websites.

Metabox (https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/) is used to create sane content editing environment.
